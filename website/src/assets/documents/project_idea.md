# Project Idea

## Motivation

Video games often incorporate small tricks to make character movement feel fun and responsive as well as making it look realistic. One commonlly employed example example is mid-air control. Allowing the controlled character or vehicle to shift their movement direction while in the air is unrealistic in almost all cases, yet many games implement mid-air control in order to make the game feel responsive. I want to look into designing a movement system with realistic inertia, while making it fun to play. I am aware that such a movement system could feel "clunky", especially for seasoned players who are used to how movement usually feels in games. Whereas many games use movement as a means to an end, in order to mitigate that potential frustration, I want to place the movement mechanics center stage. If a game is built on the premise that it has an unusual movement system and that all gameplay revolves around mastering that movement, I can reframe the potential frustration to a fun challenge.

## Gameplay

I intend the core gameplay consist of involve fighting robotic enemies. The player character has three combat options: ranged attack in form of a rifle, a melee attack by hitting enemies with the rifle and the "human bullet" option - flying into enemies at high speeds causes damage to both the enemy and the player character. The game is set on a low-gravity planetoid which means that jumping leads to longer air time than in a game set on earth. The player character has various movement options: The simplest option, walking, is similar to classic 3rd person 3d videogame walking. A slight difference is that I inted walking to be slightly slow, due to the low gravity. If on the ground, the player character can jump, again due to low gravity, relatively high. While in the air or on the ground, the player character can use the inertial crystal (see Worldbuilding) to accellerate in any desired direction.

## Approach

I must first do research into the history of movement mechanics and collect any relevant literature. This process will inform the entire game development process and must be done thoroughly. In order to get started on game development, I will set up a project in a 3D game engine and start with the movement mechanics directly. I will sketch out a craggy landscape, with many cliffs to fly over or crash into. Then I will implement preliminary combat mechanics

## Worldbuilding

Please outline a research-oriented project idea relevant to your chosen major (max. 2 A4 pages). The project description should identify your interests, provide a situation analysis, and clarify your approach. If necessary, please submit additional documents to support your project idea and note the specific requirements of your major in the next section. The submitted project idea may, but need not, be part of your future Master’s programme.

Game Design
Outline your considerations regarding the game mechanics and the function of the planned artifact (game) as well as the intended target group. In addition, describe how the artifact will contribute to the research project and, conversely, how your research will advance the artifact.
